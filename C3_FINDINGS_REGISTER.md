# C3 Findings Register

Canonical, single source of truth for every audit finding and every task's
outcome. This file lives in the repo and is git-tracked, it is not a
Downloads or project-only copy. Same pattern as Voxsanity's own register.

## 0. Purpose and convention

- **This is the one place findings live.** `c3-master-audit-protocol-v1.md`
  (method) and the original Downloads-based companion file stay as
  reference and seed material, but from 4 August 2026 this repo file is
  the live copy. If the two ever disagree, this file is correct, the
  Downloads copy was a snapshot at creation time.
- **Every task updates this file directly, in its own commit, before the
  task counts as finished.** Not a separate follow-up step, not something
  Claude.ai regenerates from a report pasted back to it. Whoever does the
  work (Claude Code, Cowork, or Claude.ai investigating live) edits this
  file as part of the same push.
- **Never delete a row. Never renumber. Update status in place. Append new
  ID ranges only.** Unchanged from the original discipline.
- **The task log (Section 1) is the audit trail.** It answers who touched
  what, when, and what the six-line report said. **The findings tables
  (Sections 3 onward) are the current-state snapshot.** They answer what is
  true right now. Both get updated every time, not one or the other.
- **Per protocol Section 15, every entry includes the six-line report**
  (compliance, removal candidates, suggestions, blind-spot self-check,
  opportunities identified, complexity or fragility flags), condensed to
  what is non-empty. An absent line reads as not checked.
- **Section headings carry their ID range in the title** (for example,
  "Section 6, IDs C3X-01 to C3X-16"), and Section 9 keeps a running count,
  the same pattern that kept Voxsanity's much larger register navigable
  once its volume grew past what a flat read-through could handle. Section
  11 has the concrete rule for when a section needs splitting further.

## 1. Task log, append only, newest first

| Date | Task or slug | What happened | Six-line report (condensed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-04 | Kickoff, laptop, no slug yet | Sammy gave the go-ahead to start. Combined prompt written: environment check, git pull, seed this file plus the protocol plus the historical companion file into the repo, then begin with the MTG fix, the live RLS/BOLA test, and Wave 1 as session time allows. Programme status flipped from on hold to started in Section 10 | Compliance: none new, planning only. Removal: none. Suggestions: none new. Blind spots: none, pure planning. Opportunities: none new. Fragility: none new |
| 2026-08-04 | Claude.ai, planning only, no slug | Sammy confirmed the programme is on hold pending other work (Voxsanity) finishing, not to start yet. Restated the anchor priorities in his own words (site works functionally, numbers correct and consistent, backend captures what will matter later, no accidental public exposure, correct legal terms, no breakage for live visitors), cross-checked against the existing plan in protocol Section 16, one gap closed (explicit check for silently-discarded source fields added to Category 1), one new standing rule added (live-site safety, protocol Section 16.2, load testing must never hit production directly) | Compliance: none new. Removal: none. Suggestions: none new. Blind spots: none identified this pass, pure planning. Opportunities: none new. Fragility: none new, this pass added a safety rule rather than finding a fragility |
| 2026-08-04 | Claude.ai, live investigation, no slug, pre-Wave 0, triggered by a GitHub Actions failure email | MTG price sync confirmed 7 days stale, not just failed today (C3L-01 to C3L-04). `collection_waitlist` public-read PII exposure found and fixed directly (C3L-05). RLS confirmed enabled schema-wide, no `authenticated` role used anywhere, account and follow data has no anon path at all (C3L-06) | Compliance: privacy conflict found and closed (C3L-05). Removal: none. Suggestions: cron jobs should check input freshness before computing derived signals. Blind spots: application code, GitHub Actions logs, and two Supabase log-service fetches were all unreachable this session. Opportunities: none new. Fragility: cron jobs reported `succeeded` for a week while operating on frozen input, nothing downstream noticed, worth a general fix |

*(Future rows go above this line, newest first. Do not overwrite or
compress old rows once this file has real history.)*

## 2. ID ranges in use

- `C3L-` : findings confirmed by direct, live investigation (database
  queries, live page fetches), not from an external report. Started
  4 August 2026.
- `C3-001` to `C3-164`: first external pass, 30 July 2026 docx, anchor
  register, status column tracks C3's own confirmation, not the original
  report's classification.
- `C3S2-`: reserved for the second external pass's structured register
  (xlsx) once provided, not yet appended, do not assume its numbering
  matches C3-001 to C3-164.
- `C3X-01` onward: findings from round-table and blind-spot passes, not
  present in either external report and not from direct live investigation.
- `OPP-01` onward: opportunity register, continuous per protocol Section 15.

## 3. Confirmed findings, live investigation (IDs C3L-01 to C3L-06)

Checked directly against the live Supabase project (`owaroeqchreuffbyakqx`)
and, where noted, the live site. Genuine confirmed evidence, not a report
being re-verified.

| ID | Finding | Evidence | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| C3L-01 | MTG price data has been stale for 7 days, not just today. Most recent `mtg_price_snapshots.snapshot_date` is 2026-07-28, checked against 2026-08-04. Every other Core game synced today or yesterday, confirming this is MTG-specific, not a platform-wide outage | Direct query, `select snapshot_date, count(*) from mtg_price_snapshots group by snapshot_date order by 1 desc`, cross-checked against the other seven Core games' equivalent tables | Critical, take down or correct now. MTG is roughly 89.8 per cent of C3's own eBay revenue, this is the highest-revenue game running on week-old prices |
| C3L-02 | Individual MTG card pages actively claim "prices updated daily... sourced from Scryfall... updated daily" while the underlying data has not moved in a week. A live, currently-true false-freshness claim, not a hypothetical wording risk | Confirmed via a live card page ("Contract from Below"), template copy directly contradicted by C3L-01's evidence | Critical, same root cause as C3L-01, the customer-facing symptom, part of the same fix not a separate one |
| C3L-03 | Two downstream pg_cron jobs (`update-mtg-price-changes-daily`, `update-mtg-signals-daily`) report `status: succeeded` every day this week, while silently computing output from data that has not changed, because their input has been frozen since 07-28. A green cron status does not mean the output is meaningful | Direct query against `cron.job_run_details` for jobs 1, 11, 15, all show `succeeded` through 08-04 | High, the real-world version of protocol Section 13, success reported is not the same as the thing the business needs being true |
| C3L-04 | `sync_events` has no record of the job that actually failed, it only logs `ids_sync_start`/`ids_sync_success` for MTG (a different, card-ID sync, which ran fine today). "Failed in 15 seconds" suggests an early-stage failure (auth, missing secret, connection, changed Scryfall endpoint) rather than a mid-sync data error, but this is inference, not confirmed | Direct query against `sync_events` filtered on `game ilike '%mtg%'`, only two event types present, neither for the failing job | High, needs Claude Code, GitHub Actions logs and the workflow file are not reachable from Claude.ai |
| C3L-05, resolved 2026-08-04 | `collection_waitlist` (raw emails: id, email, joined_at, source_card_id, source_card_name) had an `anon_read_collection_waitlist` policy with `qual: true`, any anonymous request could read every row. Every comparable table in the schema is anon-insert-only with no anon read policy, this was the one inconsistent with that pattern | Confirmed via `pg_policies`, table was empty (0 rows) at the time, nothing was actually exposed. Fixed via `apply_migration`, dropping the policy, insert confirmed still working after | Was critical, now resolved |
| C3L-06 | No table in the public schema uses the `authenticated` role in any policy, `rowsecurity` is `true` on all roughly 140 tables checked. Account, follow, and follow-magic-link data has no `anon` policy at all beyond `service_role`, the browser cannot touch those tables directly under any circumstance | Confirmed via `pg_tables.rowsecurity` and `pg_policies` across the full schema | Informational, positive finding, but shifts real risk to Netlify function code, which this session could not read. Section 12's authentication-without-authorisation pattern still needs checking there specifically |

**What Claude.ai's tools could not reach, 4 August session:** the GitHub
Actions workflow file and run logs (no GitHub connector, repo is private),
the Netlify function source presumably performing the MTG sync, and
Supabase's own `api` and `postgres` log services (both fetches failed at
the tool level, not retried). All three are Claude Code's job.

## 4. Reported findings, confirm-first (19 of the full C3-001 to C3-164 range, a curated subset, not the whole register, see note below)

Every row is a claim from the external reports (30 July docx, 1 August
report), not yet independently confirmed. First action on each is live
confirmation, not acting on the report's word alone. Where confirmed and
still broken, act immediately. Where already fixed, mark Resolved with
evidence, do not re-litigate.

**Note on completeness:** this table holds the 19 individual C3-IDs (12
rows, some grouping 2 to 3 related IDs) already triaged as highest priority
from the 30 July docx's full 164-finding register. It is not the whole
164. The rest still lives only in that docx, untriaged into this file. As
each remaining C3-ID gets checked, add its own row here rather than
assuming it is covered by proximity to one that already is.

| ID | Finding | Reported severity | Confirm how | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C3-024/025 | Warhammer 40,000 booster box EV calculator models a fictitious product (12-pack Collector Booster, 14-card Play Boosters, serialised chase cards); real release is four Commander decks | Critical | Fetch the live EV page, compare against Wizards' own product documentation | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-027/028 | Zendikar Expeditions EV model internally contradictory on expected quantity and acquisition mechanic | Critical | Fetch the live EV page, check stated pack odds against the actual Expeditions insertion mechanic | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-032/033 | Final Fantasy and Modern Horizons 3 EV models include a serialised or Collector-only card as if pullable from a standard Play Booster | Critical | Fetch both live pages, check slot eligibility against Wizards' own product pages | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-026/029/030 | Zendikar Rising and Commander Legends EV models use the current Play Booster structure on products that predate it or use a different structure | High | Fetch live pages, cross-check release-year product structure | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-031 | Jeweled Lotus described as a current Commander staple after its ban | High | Fetch live page, check current banlist | Not yet confirmed live |
| EV verdict | EV pages can show a purchase verdict before an actual box cost is entered, and can show contradictory verdicts simultaneously | High | Load a sampled EV page pre-input, capture initial state | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-075 | WWW and apex hostnames may serve different site generations | High | Fetch both hostnames, diff. Note: 12 July Netlify duplicate-project issue was separately closed, this may already be resolved | Likely resolved, confirm to close formally |
| C3-076/077 | Legacy `.html` routes remain live alongside clean routes, with different content (Tarkir: Dragonstorm cited) | High | Fetch both route forms for a sample, diff, check for a 301 | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-122 | Pricing page describes paid tiers as planned; `/legal` describes an existing, billed subscription | High, now a named 2026-27 ACCC enforcement priority | Fetch pricing page and `/legal` together, diff subscription language | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-001/003 | "Exact AUD," "local price," used where the value is a converted or modelled estimate | High | Grep all copy for these phrases, cross-check actual data source | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-012/013 | Tracked-game count still conflicts (31 vs 32) somewhere live, despite the 11 July fix | Medium | Grep for hard-coded game counts sitewide | Not yet confirmed live |
| C3-059 | Quiz count conflicts (29 vs an older figure) somewhere live | Low | Confirm the 12 July fix reached every page stating a quiz count | Not yet confirmed live |

---

## 5. Prioritised action tiers

See protocol Section 7 for the reasoning. Update as each lens closes.

**Tier 0, take down or correct now:** Section 4 above, once each row is
confirmed live, plus C3L-01/02 (Section 3), already confirmed.

**Tier 1, critical, launch-blocking:**
- RLS and BOLA verification, the two-account object-level access test
  specifically (protocol Section 4). Section 3's C3L-06 confirms the
  database layer, this test has not yet run.
- Stripe checkout idempotency key usage, confirmed present on every charge
  and subscription-creation call, not assumed from webhook-side signature
  checking alone.
- Stripe webhook signature, replay, and idempotency verification (C3-098),
  including duplicate delivery of the same event ID.
- Stripe webhook handler write pattern confirmed as insert-first under a
  database unique constraint, not check-then-insert.
- Premium entitlement decided server-side only, never trusted from a
  client-supplied field or local storage (C3-097).
- Password-reset token controls and account-enumeration resistance
  (C3-101/102).

**Tier 2, high:**
- EV catalogue-wide rebuild against the immutable-product-record method.
- Cross-page price and trend reconciliation invariant.
- Affiliate link integrity sweep, all 32 games.
- Card and printing identity stability across pages.
- Follow and alert email-abuse controls (C3-115).
- The MTG sync fix itself (C3L-01 to C3L-04), root cause and repair.

**Tier 3, medium:** content and SEO items, legacy template coexistence,
structured-data accuracy, third-party integration health.

**Tier 4, low and long-term:** redundancy sweep, chaos and resilience
testing, monetisation scouting, Section 7 below.

## 6. Blind-spot findings, round-table and self-review derived (IDs C3X-01 to C3X-16)

Not present in either external report, and not from direct live
investigation, this range's provenance is round-table and self-critique
passes.

| ID | Finding | Why it matters | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| C3X-01 | No sweep confirms zero remaining references to `dragonball_cards` or `dragonballz_cards` where `dbsfusionworld_cards` is correct, across code, content, and the apitcg enrichment job once it runs | This exact confusion has already caused real mistakes historically | High |
| C3X-02 | The apitcg dry run's 14 unmatched rows (99.93 per cent match) have no defined handling, silently null, silently wrong, or flagged is unknown | A small known gap can still mislead if it renders as a confident-looking wrong value | Medium |
| C3X-03 | Flesh and Blood's exclusion is policy-documented but not confirmed as a code-level guard in the 32-game `GAME_CONFIG` pattern | A future copy-paste could reintroduce FaB by accident, breaching LSS's restriction | Medium |
| C3X-04 | Single-supplier concentration, primary income depends on Dice Arcade Miranda alone | Real business-continuity risk, not previously logged as an audit item | Long-term, business not technical |
| C3X-05 | Credential-chain bus-factor, no documented recovery sequence for registrar, Netlify, Supabase, Stripe, MailerLite, Resend if the operator loses simultaneous access | Mirrors the external report's general "recovery matters as much as prevention" finding, no C3-specific version existed | High |
| C3X-06 | The 11 July count-constant fix not swept for every page stating a card or game count | Same failure shape as C3-012/013, a fix confirmed on checked pages can still be open elsewhere | Medium |
| C3X-07 | Unit economics against the AU$10,000/month goal not checked against real numbers in any pass so far | The audit checks correctness and safety, not progress against the stated financial goal | Medium, once data-integrity work is trustworthy |
| C3X-08 | No formal ToS or licensing review for four of eight external stat APIs (YGOPRODeck, Lorcast, optcgapi.com, swu-db.com) | Single point of failure, no company SLA, previously logged but never given a formal priority | Medium |
| C3X-09 | eBay store inventory count differs across site sections and against the live dashboard | Same failure class as C3-012/013, a number that should come from one source and does not | Medium |
| C3X-10 | No control considered for a bad-faith actor feeding the AI-assisted content pipeline false product information, to test whether it publishes uncorrected | Panel 1, adversarial and abuse-case | Medium |
| C3X-11 | Stripe checkout path's idempotency key usage unconfirmed, a more likely failure mode than webhook forgery, not previously its own item | Panel 2, concurrency and idempotency | Critical, now Tier 1 |
| C3X-12 | Webhook out-of-order and duplicate-delivery handling unconfirmed beyond a basic signature check | Panel 2, concurrency and idempotency | High |
| C3X-13 | No git-history sweep on auth-adjacent files checking whether authorisation logic was quietly altered across many incremental Claude Code sessions | Panel 3, AI-generated-code risk | High |
| C3X-14 | The authentication-without-authorisation pattern had not been named or specifically searched for in any existing review | Panel 3, AI-generated-code risk | Critical, feeds directly into protocol Section 4 |
| C3X-15 | No concrete scale-multiplication test cases existed despite performance being in scope | Panel 2, concurrency and idempotency | High |
| C3X-16 | The tier system has no explicit safeguard against a hard-to-fix finding being quietly downgraded over time | Panel 5, business-outcome grounding | Low, process discipline |

---

## 7. Hypothetical and future-scenario test cases, ready to run

Generated from protocol Section 11's four patterns, mapped to the
execution slug that should run each one.

| Scenario | Generator pattern | Slug | What a pass looks like |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 concurrent users versus 2,000, across price sync, follow-alert send, search, and Stripe checkout at once | Scale multiplication | `8-perf` | The specific component that degrades first is named, not assumed |
| Daily price refresh runs while thousands of users are actively browsing | Scale multiplication | `8-perf`, `3-pricing` | No page ever renders a mix of yesterday's and today's snapshot |
| Same email signs up twice inside one second | Duplicate and replay | `0-rls`, `6-adversarial` | Second attempt rejected cleanly, no duplicate account |
| Follow-alert submitted twice before the first confirmation sends | Duplicate and replay | `10-alerts` | Deduplicated server-side, not two confirmation emails |
| Same Stripe webhook event ID delivered twice | Duplicate and replay | `6-adversarial` | Second delivery is a no-op, no duplicate entitlement or charge |
| Checkout retried after a client-side timeout | Duplicate and replay | `6-adversarial` | Idempotency key prevents a second charge |
| Two overlapping sync runs for the same game | Race condition | `5-datasync` | Last-write-wins is explicit and intentional, not accidental |
| Tier or entitlement check reads mid-webhook-write | Race condition | `0-rls`, `6-adversarial` | The check always reads committed state, never a partial write |
| Full-catalogue scrape attempt | Attacker mindset | `7-abuse` | A named, tested control exists, not an assumed one |
| Email-bomb attempt via the follow feature | Attacker mindset | `7-abuse`, `10-alerts` | Per-email and per-IP limits actually tested against the live endpoint |
| Cross-user object access via ID or UUID substitution | Attacker mindset | `0-rls` | Covered directly by protocol Section 4's method |

---

## 8. Opportunity register (IDs OPP-01 to OPP-06)

Continuous, per protocol Section 15. Any task that spots something C3's
data or architecture could do that a competitor plausibly cannot adds a row
here immediately, whether or not that was its assigned scope.

| ID | Opportunity | What makes it defensible | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| OPP-01 | AU liquidity signal, a "days to sell" or listed-versus-sold spread from C3's own eBay transaction history | Real transaction data competitors lack, MTG-only for now | Sold-data pipeline stays MTG-scoped until other Core games have volume |
| OPP-02 | Multi-source price confidence score, how many of the eight external sources agree on a price | No competitor polls all eight sources C3 aggregates | EV and price-accuracy work closing first |
| OPP-03 | AU-specific grading EV calculator using real AU graded-versus-raw comps | Differentiated from PSA and US-centric tools | Blocked on sold-data pipeline access, already correctly deferred |
| OPP-04 | Release-calendar-driven early movement alerts using `tcg_releases` across all 32 games | Most competitors track this manually per game | Generators and calendar expansion, already D9-approved |
| OPP-05 | Trustworthy booster box EV, once rebuilt, as a genuine differentiator using real AU box and singles prices | Turns the current core defect into a real advantage once fixed | Tier 1 and Tier 2 work closing first |
| OPP-06 | Data-license or API product once AU sold data is trustworthy, aimed at AU LGS or resellers | Same pattern Voxsanity logged for its own data | Sold-data pipeline access, blocked pending the Seller Hub re-export decision |

---

## 9. Summary counts

Updated whenever a task changes the counts below, not left to go stale.
Same discipline as Voxsanity's own Section 5.

- **Live-investigation findings (C3L-):** 6 total, 1 resolved (C3L-05), 2
  critical and still open (C3L-01, C3L-02), 2 high and still open (C3L-03,
  C3L-04), 1 informational (C3L-06).
- **Reported findings tracked here (C3- subset):** 19 individual IDs across
  12 rows, all still unconfirmed live. This is a curated subset of the full
  external 164, not the whole set, see the note under Section 4.
- **Blind-spot findings (C3X-):** 16 total. 2 critical (C3X-11, C3X-14), 4
  high (C3X-01, C3X-05, C3X-12, C3X-13, C3X-15), 8 medium, 2 low or process.
- **Opportunities (OPP-):** 6 total, all still gated behind other work
  closing first, none actionable standalone yet.
- **Resolved this file's lifetime:** 1 (C3L-05).
- **Total rows this file currently tracks:** 47, across 4 ID ranges, out of
  a much larger universe (at minimum the full 164 in the external docx,
  plus whatever the 13-wave programme surfaces once it starts). This
  number is expected to grow quickly once Wave 1 runs, that growth is the
  reason Section 11 exists.

---

## 10. Current state, what to pick up next

**Programme status: started, 4 August 2026.** Sammy gave the go-ahead to
begin on the laptop. The earlier hold (this section, prior entry) is
lifted. The MTG sync fix question is resolved by this, it is now Tier 0
inside the started programme, not a separate decision.

Priority order for this and following sessions:

1. **Environment check first**, per the standing addendum, before any of
   the below.
2. **The MTG sync failure** (Section 3, C3L-01 to C3L-04). Needs the actual
   GitHub Actions workflow file, its recent run history and error output,
   and whatever script or function it calls. A credential expiry, a
   changed Scryfall endpoint, or a workflow file edit around 28 July are
   plausible given the fifteen-second failure time, but unconfirmed, treat
   as inference only until the real log is read.
3. Protocol Section 4's RLS/BOLA test, the two-account object-level access
   test specifically. The database layer is confirmed closed (C3L-06), the
   live application-level test has not run yet.
4. Wave 1 slugs (`1-claims`, `3-pricing`, `4-links`) as session time allows,
   each in its own worktree per Part 0.
5. This section becomes a pointer to whichever wave or slug is currently
   active, updated by whoever picks up the next task, every time, not just
   at convenient checkpoints.

---

## 11. How to work through this file across sessions

1. Open this file at the start of any task that touches anything it could
   plausibly cover, not just audit-labelled tasks. A bug fix, a feature
   build, anything that could confirm, close, or contradict a row here
   counts.
2. Update Status fields and the Summary counts (Section 9) in place as work
   happens. Never delete a row. The task log (Section 1) gets a new row at
   the top every time, the findings tables get edited in place.
3. When the second external pass's structured register (the 1 August
   report's xlsx) becomes available, append it as `C3S2-` per Section 2,
   cross-check for overlap with the existing C3- and C3X- ranges before
   treating anything in it as wholly new, note any confirmed duplicate
   rather than double-counting it in Section 9.
4. **Once any single section's table exceeds roughly 25 to 30 rows,** split
   that section into `###` subsections by theme, the way category size
   forced Voxsanity's own register to break Section 3 into ten subsections
   rather than one long table. This file has not hit that size yet
   (largest section is 16 rows), but Wave 1 alone could push several
   sections past it quickly, watch for it rather than waiting for the file
   to become unreadable before acting.
5. Before declaring any wave or slug "done," re-read protocol Sections 0
   and 15 first, the two mandates and the no-known-safe rule. The habit
   this file exists to catch is calling something complete too early, that
   check is part of the process, not optional.
